# Basics
* Javascript extension library
* maintained by Microsoft
* adding strong, static types to Javascript => clean and readable code

## Why Typescript?
* Coding errors can be caught in the development process earlier
    - spots bugs and typos
* Static types allow tools to be build that improve the developer experience and productivity
* Javascript features that aren't implemented in all the browsers yet can actually be used in an app that targets those browsers
    - TS allows us to use some features in JS that haven't yet been adopted by all browsers but still target those browsers
    - TS achives this by transpiling the use of these features down to JS code that the targeted browser does support
    -
