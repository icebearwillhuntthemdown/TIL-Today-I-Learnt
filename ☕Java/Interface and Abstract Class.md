# Interface and Abstract Class

## Interface
Methods that a particular class that implements the interface must implement with **implements** keyword. Interface itself is **abstract** meaning there's no code inside the methods' code blocks, but only method signatures(name and parameters). 

### Why use Interface?
To standardise the way of a particular set of classes is used. Interface is used to provide a common behaviour that can be used by several classes by having them all implement the same interface. Access modifier is not necessary as its methods are meant to be implemented in other classes.

### Naming convention
Put an I at the beginning of the name. e.g.)ITelephone, IUser

### Generic Type 

### Examples
Linked List, Array List implements List interface, meaning they all have the methods defined in List interface.
