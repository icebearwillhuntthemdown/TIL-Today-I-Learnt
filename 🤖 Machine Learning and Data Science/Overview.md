### Why ML?
"To turn data from useless to useful"  
To use machines to predict results based on incoming data. In other words, to get insights from massive amount of data so that we can make better decisions. As the accumulation of data is getting massive and massive, we give the data to machines in order to optimize and automate the process and avoid human errors.

### Types of ML
* Supervised : When dealing with labeled data. Classification, Regression
* Unsupervised : When the data given has no labels. Clustering, Association, Rule learning
* Reinforcement : Teaching machines through trial and error. Skill acquisition, Real time learning

### NoSQL : Not Only SQL, Non-relational DataBase
NoSQL is used to store huge amounts of unstructured data in a different format than relational database.
<br/>
##### +) unstructured data?  
Images, audios, user behaviour, user likes, user purchasing history, etc.

##### Types of NoSQL Database
* Document databases
* Key-value databases
* Wide-column stores
* Graph databases
