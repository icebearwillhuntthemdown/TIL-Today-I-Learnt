### Why ML?
"To turn data from useless to useful".
In other words, to get insights from massive amount of data so that we can make better decisions.  
As the accumulation of data gets massive, we give the data to machines in order to optimize and automate the process and avoid human errors.

### NoSQL : Not Only SQL, Non-relational DataBase
NoSQL is used to store huge amounts of unstructured data in a different format than relational database.
e.g.) user behaviour, user likes, user purchasing history

##### Types of NoSQL Database
* Document databases
* Key-value databases
* Wide-column stores
* Graph databases
