## App Components
Each component is an etnry point through which the system or a user can enter your app.

**Component Types**
- Activities
    - the entry point for interacting with the user. It represents a single screen with a UI.  
- Services 
    - a component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations or to perform work for remote processes. 
- Broadcast receivers
    - a component that enables the system to deliver events to the tapp outside of a regular user flow, allowing the app to respond to system-wide broadcast announcements. (e.g. screen has turned off, the battery is low, a picture was captured)
- Content providers

**Intent**
A passive data structure holding an abstract description of an action to be performed. The glue between activities.
