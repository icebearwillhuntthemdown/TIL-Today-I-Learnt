# Server and Client Template Engine

## Template Engine
Templating is a programmatic approach to simplify processing of data from one format into another. Template Engine, also known as template processor or template parser, is a software designed to combine templates with a data model to produce result documents like HTML.  

* Server Template Engine
Templating is done on the server side, so the server prepares the entire HTML document and sends it back to the client.

* Client Template Engine
Templating is done on the client side and the server only sends data in json/xml format. 

##### Terminology

* SPA : Single Page Application
