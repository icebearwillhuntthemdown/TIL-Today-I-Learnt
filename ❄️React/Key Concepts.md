# Key Concepts

**React is...**
* Declarative  
  Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
* Component-based  
  Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.
* Learn once, write anywhere  
  You can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.
